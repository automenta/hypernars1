Robust NAL Parser: The current ExpressionEvaluator could be upgraded to a more formal, grammar-based parser (e.g., using
a library like Nearley or ANTLR). This would make it much more robust at handling complex, nested NAL statements with
variables, as suggested in the enhance files.

Distributed NAR Architecture: For a significant leap in scalability, you could implement the distributed processing
architecture proposed in enhance.g.md. This would involve creating a ConnectionManager for inter-node communication and
a strategy for partitioning the knowledge base across a cluster.

Knowledge Provenance System: To make contradiction resolution even more intelligent, you could build a system to track
the provenance (source) of every belief, as suggested in enhance.f.md. This would allow the ContradictionManager to
factor source reliability into its decisions.

Full Variable Unification: The query system could be extended to support full NAL-style variable unification, moving
from simple pattern matching to a more powerful constraint satisfaction model as detailed in enhance.b.md.
