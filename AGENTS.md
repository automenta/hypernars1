# Code Guidelines

- Elegance
    - abstract, modularize
    - syntax: ternary, switch, etc
    - consolidate
    - deduplicate
- No comments: rely purely on self-documenting code and meaningful identifiers
- Latest versions of JavaScript and dependencies
- Professional-grade, not explanatory/educational
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
