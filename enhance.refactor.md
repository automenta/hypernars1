Rename for Clarity: Many internal methods are prefixed with _, which is a good convention. However, some could be
renamed for even greater clarity. For example, in AdvancedDerivationEngine, _deriveTemporalRelation could be renamed _
deriveTransitiveTemporalRelation to be more specific. An IDE's 'Rename Symbol' feature can do this safely across the
entire project.

Extract Method: Some methods, like _resolveContradiction in AdvancedContradictionManager, have several if/else if blocks
for different strategies. You could use your IDE's 'Extract Method' feature to pull each of these blocks into its own
private method (e.g., _resolveByStrength, _resolveByTemporalContext). This would make the main method much cleaner and
easier to read.

Consolidate Utilities: There are utils.js files in both src/core and src/support. These could likely be merged into a
single, shared utils module to reduce potential code duplication and centralize common helper functions.

Introduce Parameter Objects: Some methods have a large number of parameters. For example, Hyperedge.revise takes (truth,
budget, beliefCapacity, premises, context, derivedBy). This could be refactored to take a single options object (e.g.,
revise(options)). This makes the method signature cleaner and more extensible if you need to add more parameters later.
Most modern IDEs have a refactoring tool to automate this.
