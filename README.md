# HyperNARS

## THIS IS AN UNTESTED GENERAL-PURPOSE REASONING SYSTEM DERIVED FROM NARS (NON-AXIOMATIC REASONING SYSTEM)
## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

**Seed** - `prompt.md` - This is the original content used to start the process.  This can always be improved, requiring restarting the development process.

**Code** - `hypernars.?.js` - the numbers are the version, derived directly from the previous.  it's possible that some data was lost between iterations.

**Enhancements** - `enhance.?.md` - proposals for design enhancements, often with source code.  each file includes several proposals and a summary.  among the files, there is some overlap that should be clustered and synthesized.

## TODO
- Apply the best enhance.?.md enhancements to hypergraph_nars.4.js
- Develop comprehensive Unit Tests
- Test the System
- Develop API
- Develop GUI
- Formalize specification
- Translate to other architectures

## Development
